# simple-pdo
## i have made this repository for practical consumption and fun; both.
### there are lots of PDO tutorials on internet which you may find helpful. if you want to know how PDO methods, pre-defined constants and all other staffs work, then you may find this repository also helpful
### finally, my target is to build a CRUD based on this simple system where I could use some packages and composer to make it look interesting
## i'll definitely keep adding them as long as PDO works
